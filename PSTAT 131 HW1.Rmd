Question 1:
Define supervised and unsupervised learning. What are the difference(s) between them?

Supervised learning, the response data Y is the supervisor which gets access to the "answer key", or the correct responses. Unsupervised learning doesn't have such an answer key
Regression falls generally under supervised learning.
Supervised learning is Mechanistic and Parametric, while Unsupervised is emperically-driven

Question 2:
Explain the difference between a regression model and a classification model, specifically in the context of machine learning.

Regression models are for continuous variables, while classification models are discrete.
Classification has what's called a Bayes classifier, which assigns each observation to the most likely class, given its predictor values.
Regression uses MSE as a accuracy measurement, while classification uses the error rate for the training and test sets.

Question 3:
Name two commonly used metrics for regression ML problems. Name two commonly used metrics for classification ML problems.



For regression, MSE and the bias-variance decomposition are used.
For classification, the training error rate and the Bayes classifier are used.

Question 4:
As discussed, statistical models can be used for different purposes. These purposes can generally be classified into the following three categories. Provide a brief description of each.

Predictive: The aim is to predict Y (response variable) with minimal error (not including irreducible error)

Descriptive: Aim is to highlight a trend for easy readability by a customer or reader

Inferential: "What is the significant part of the model?"
Used to test theories and casual claims



Question 5:
Predictive models are frequently used in machine learning, and they can usually be described as either mechanistic or empirically-driven. Answer the following questions.

Define mechanistic. Define empirically-driven. How do these model types differ? How are they similar?



In general, is a mechanistic or empirically-driven model easier to understand? Explain your choice.

Describe how the bias-variance tradeoff is related to the use of mechanistic or empirically-driven models.

A mechanistic model assumes a parametric form for f and has flexibility in number of parameters. Emperically driven models require a larger number of observations, don't assume f's form, and can end up overfitting.
Mechanistic models can also overfit if you add too many parameters.

Since the empericial model has higher flexibility by default, the mechanistic model is easier to understand, as interpretability and flexibility generally follow an inverse linear relationship.

Flexible models generally have low bias and high variance, so if you want a model with high bias but low variance, you should pick a mechanistic model, otherwise, pick emperically-driven.

Question 6:
A political candidate’s campaign has collected some detailed voter history data from their constituents. The campaign is interested in two questions:

Given a voter’s profile/data, how likely is it that they will vote in favor of the candidate?

How would a voter’s likelihood of support for the candidate change if they had personal contact with the candidate?

Classify each question as either predictive or inferential. Explain your reasoning for each.

1. Predictive, since we are trying to predict a response variable in response to a number of input charecteristics.

2. Inferential, since we are trying to test a casual claim between personal contact with the candidate and a change in likelihood of support for the candidate.

Exploratory Data Analysis
This section will ask you to complete several exercises. For this homework assignment, we’ll be working with the mpg data set that is loaded when you load the tidyverse. Make sure you load the tidyverse and any other packages you need.

Exploratory data analysis (or EDA) is not based on a specific set of rules or formulas. It is more of a state of curiosity about data. It’s an iterative process of:

generating questions about data
visualize and transform your data as necessary to get answers
use what you learned to generate more questions
A couple questions are always useful when you start out. These are “what variation occurs within the variables,” and “what covariation occurs between the variables.”

You should use the tidyverse and ggplot2 for these exercises.
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)



Exercise 1:
We are interested in highway miles per gallon, or the hwy variable. Create a histogram of this variable. Describe what you see/learn.
```{r hwy}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
hwy <- mpg$hwy
hist(hwy)
```

Exercise 2:
Create a scatterplot. Put hwy on the x-axis and cty on the y-axis. Describe what you notice. Is there a relationship between hwy and cty? What does this mean?

```{r cty}
data(mpg)

cty <- mpg$cty
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cty)) +
    geom_point()
```
There seems to be a linear relationship between hwy and cty.
That means a high hwy mpg is correlated to a high cty mpg, and vice versa.


Exercise 3:
Make a bar plot of manufacturer. Flip it so that the manufacturers are on the y-axis. Order the bars by height. Which manufacturer produced the most cars? Which produced the least?

Lincoln produced the least cars, Dodge produced the most.

```{r manu}
data(mpg)
manu <- mpg$manufacturer
ggplot(mpg, aes(y = fct_infreq(manu))) + geom_bar(stat = 'count')
```
Exercise 4:
Make a box plot of hwy, grouped by cyl. Do you see a pattern? If so, what?

```{r cyl}
data(mpg)
cyl <- mpg$cyl
ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy, cyl)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = cyl))
```

Exercise 5:
Use the corrplot package to make a lower triangle correlation matrix of the mpg dataset. (Hint: You can find information on the package here.)

```{r mat}
library(corrplot)
data(mpg)
M <- cor(mpg[, unlist(lapply(mpg, is.numeric))])   
corrplot(M, method = 'circle', order = 'FPC', type = 'lower', diag = FALSE)
```
Which variables are positively or negatively correlated with which others? Do these relationships make sense to you? Are there any that surprise you?


cylinders is positively correlated with displacement and negatively correlated with city and highway mpg's.
displacement is also negatively correlated with city and highway mpg's.

I'm surprised that the year has no correlation with the mpg in the city and highway, as I expected newer cars to be more fuel efficient.

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
